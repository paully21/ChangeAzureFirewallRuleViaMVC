ChangeAzureFirewallRuleViaMVC
=============================

**Simple MVC site for changing an Azure SQL Server firewall rule**

Use case
--------

One of our freelance devs needed to change the Azure SQL server firewall rules. He often worked in different locations and his home Internet access was via a dynamic IP address.

Instead of granting him access to the Azure portal, I created a simple MVC application that would allow him to change his firewall whenever he wants.

This is a simple use of the Azure Management Libraries. Special thanks to [Brady Gaster's article](http://www.bradygaster.com/post/managing-windows-azure-sql-databases-using-the-management-libraries-for-net) on the management libraries for getting me started.
